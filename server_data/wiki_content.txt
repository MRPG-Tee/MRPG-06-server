#Account leveling
[Account Leveling] - allows players to progress the levels of individual character classes, including both combat and crafting professions, rather than leveling the account itself. With no level cap, players can continually advance each class. Each new level grants Upgrade Points, which can be spent to enhance abilities, skills, and professions, allowing for ongoing growth and customization across various aspects of gameplay.

#Achievements system
[The Achievement System] - rewards players with Achievement Points for completing various milestones across diverse categories, from item collection to PVP victories. Players can earn special titles and unique items as rewards, marking their accomplishments and progress within the game. This system encourages exploration and mastery across different aspects of gameplay, adding depth and goals for all types of players.

#Aethernet
[Aethers] - are mystical gateways found in specific zones that allow players to instantly teleport between worlds for a fee, which varies by distance or destination. Once activated, each Aether unlocks access to new areas within the teleportation network, making exploration, questing, and regrouping with allies faster and more efficient. As players unlock more Aethers, travel across realms becomes streamlined, opening up seamless movement through the gameâ€™s expansive world.
